-The second user must guess that word using letters that it could potentially contain into the second input field that appears after the first users turn
-A box on the left provides the second user with information on the letters previously guessed
-Every wrong guess adds to the space ship and builds it
-On the right side of the screen is a scoreboard that collects information based on the second players wins and losses and stores it in the local memory of the users computer
-At the bottom is a box field that provides the second user with information on their current correct guesses and progress on formulating the word provided by the first user
